				Pay Slip Calculation Details (salary-payslip) API 0.0.1 release
	    		-------------------------------------------------------------
	    		
Welcome to the Pay Slip Calculation Details API 0.0.1 release!  This release includes versions of the 
salary-payslip API implementation.

JDK Version notes
=============================================================================================

The salary-payslip API supports JDK 1.8 or higher and Maven 3.0 or higher.  Note that I have currently tested this 
implementation with JDK 1.8

Assumptions 
==============================================================================================
		1. Salary input data file is in the "src/main/resources/salarydata.csv" folder with the following
		format.
		
			(first name, last name, annual salary, super rate (%), payment start date)
			(David,Rudd,60050,9%,01 March – 31 March).
		
		2. All input data are validated according to the following rules.
		
		   	first name : Allows only alphabet characters
		   	last name  : Allows only alphabet characters
		   	annual salary : Integers
		   	super rate    : (0% - 50% inclusive)
		   	payment start date : Not going to validate it
		   
		3. Pay slip calculation details will be  written into the src/main/resources/payslip.csv.
		
		4. You can change the following properties in the application.properties file according to the requirement.
		
			salary.data.file.type=csv (If you change this you should  implement the actual implementation)
			salary.data.file.path=src/main/resources/salarydata.csv
			payslip.file.path=src/main/resources/paySlip.csv
			financial.year=FINANCIAL_YEAR_2012_To_2013 (If you change this you should  implement the actual implementation)
			
			All tax related configuration will be in this file. 
			
	    5. To run the test, type "mvn test"
	       
	        This will run the following test classes 
	         1. PaySlipManagerIntegrationTest.java - Which will read the sample salarydata.csv file and generate the paySlip.csv file
	         2. PermanentEmployeePaySlipTest.java - Which will cover the all functions related to the salary calculations.
	         3. TaxCalculation2012To2013Test.java - Which will cover the tax calculations related to the  FINANCIAL_YEAR_2012_To_2013 implementation.
	         4. ValidationManagerTest.java - Which will cover the validation of the all input data
