				Calculate the Total Printing cost (printingcost) API 0.0.1 release
	    		-------------------------------------------------------------
	    		
Welcome to the Calculate Total Printing cost API 0.0.1 release!  This release includes versions of the 
printingcost API implementation.

JDK Version notes
=============================================================================================

The printingcost API supports JDK 1.6 or higher.  Note that I have currently tested this 
implementation with  1.6 and 1.7.

This Application process the file and print the total cost of it. The file type can be given as a 
command line argument. Currently it supports only .csv file. If there is no any input from the user, system 
takes the default file type as .csv and start the execution.

Assumptions 
==============================================================================================
		1. This Application currently supports only A4 page type and for others it returns an error message.
		2. If there are errors in the input file, application prints those errors in the
		   terminal and terminate the process.
		3. All prices of the page types are in the application.properties file.
		4. Sample data (10,5,true,A4) =>(total pages,total color pages,is double side,page type)

GIT - Please use the branch "processPrintJobs" to clone  source files from the bare repository.
